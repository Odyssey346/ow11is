## A perfectly opinionated script to improve Windows 11.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser # Required to run remote scripts (only once)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Odyssey346/ow11is/master/ow11is.ps1 | iex # Todo: make this shorter
```

Administrator privileges are required to run this script.

## Recommended Software List
You will get a prompt to install the following software, it's totally optional:

- [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/powertoys)
- [QuickLook](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook)

You also get a prompt to install MSEdgeRedirect, which redirects all hard-coded Microsoft Edge links to your default browser. Optional, but very recommended.
